## Windows Server Core Overview

Microsoft starting with Windows Server 2016 has an option of Server Core installation. The Server Core option reduces the amount of space required on disk, the potential attack surface, and especially the servicing requirements. It is recommended that you choose the Server Core installation unless you have a need for the additional user interface elements and graphical management tools that are included in the Server with Desktop Experience option. For an even more lightweight option, see the next section on Nano Server. Server Core allows you to install various Server roles that may not be available in Nano Server including those listed below:

- Active Directory Certificate Services
- Active Directory Domain Services
- DHCP Server
- DNS Server
- File Services (including File Server Resource Manager)
- Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)
- Hyper-V
- Print and Document Services
- Streaming Media Services
- Web Server (including a subset of ASP.NET)
- Windows Server Update Server
- Active Directory Rights Management Server
- Routing and Remote Access Server and the following sub-roles:
- Remote Desktop Services Connection Broker
- Licensing
- Virtualization
- Volume Activation Services

For a comprehensive list of features available in Server Core, visit [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server-docs/get-started/getting-started-with-server-core](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server-docs/get-started/getting-started-with-server-core).

## Windows Nano Server Overview

Nano Server is optimized as a lightweight operating system for running "cloud-native" applications based on containers and micro-services. There are important differences in Nano Server versus Server Core. As of Windows Server 2016, version 1803, Nano Server is available only as a container base OS image. You must run it as a container in a container host, such as a Server Core installation of Windows Server. Running a container based on Nano Server in this release differs from releases prior to 1803 in the ways listed below:

- Nano Server has been optimized for .NET Core applications
- Nano Server size has been optimized in Windows Server 2019 version
- PowerShell Core, .NET Core, and WMI are no longer included by default as they were in Windows Server 2016, but you can include PowerShell Core and .NET Core container packages when building your container
- There is no longer a servicing stack included in Nano Server. Microsoft publishes an updated Nano image to Docker Hub that you redeploy
- You troubleshoot the new Nano Container by using Docker
- You can now run Nano containers on IoT Core

For a comprehensive list of capability differences between Nano Server and Server Core, visit [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/getting-started-with-nano-server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/getting-started-with-nano-server))


Since Windows Server 2016, Microsoft offers both Nano Server and Server Core in the form of Docker images through Docker Hub. With the GA of Windows Server 2019, Microsoft also announced that its base images will now be hosted in the Microsoft Container Registery or MCR. For information on this change, visit [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-syndicates-container-catalog/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-syndicates-container-catalog/). These images will still be discoverable via Docker Hub.  The nature of application you are building typically dictates your selection of base image. For example, the SQL Server 2016 Express image will need Server Core as its base image, but a simple windows service may able to run just fine on Nano server. In the following exercise, you will run a  basic "hello world" container leveraging both the Nano and Server Core images. 

# Run a container based on the Nano Server base image

1. Ensure you are in the Lab on Demand (LOD) Windows VM.

1. You will need to run the commands in this section using the PowerShell console as an administrator. Right click the **PowerShell** icon on the taskbar and select "**Run as Administrator**".

    ![](content/image3.png)

1. The PowerShell console is now available to you. Make sure you are inside of the **module2** labs directory. You can do that by running the command `cd C:\labs\module2\ ` This will put you inside the **module2** lab folder where all the necessary files are located. Notice the file **Lab 2 Commands Sheet.txt** that contains the commands you will execute as part of this lab.  

    ![](content/image4.png)

1. First, let's get the list of all the container images available on this Docker host by running the command `docker images`. Notice that you already have **windows/servercore** and **windows/nanoserver** images available to you representing **Server Core** and **Nano Server** images.   

    >Knowledge: It's important to understand that you can always download specific version of **windows/servercore** and **windows/nanoserver** images by using an appropriate tag. For example, `docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:10.0.17763.437` will pull the server core image that has a version number 10.0.17763.437. Notice the [mcr.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-syndicates-container-catalog/) registry that is the container registry hosted on Microsoft servers, even though the images are discoverable on Docker Hub. All the concepts you learned about docker (Linux) containers and images generally apply as-is to windows containers too. The main deference is the fact that windows containers require the windows operating system as a host, while the Linux containers require Linux operating system.  

    ![](content/image5_2.PNG)

1. You will now run a container based on **Server Core** image (**mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore**). Before you do that, run the command `hostname`. This will reveal the hostname of your virtual machine. 
    >Note:Please note that your host machine name may be different.

    ![](content/image6.png)

1. Run the command `docker run -it mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:1809 powershell `. Please be patient as it will take a minute or so for this command to work. The **-it** switch provides you with an interactive session. The **powershell** is a parameter passed as an argument which basically gives you access to Powershell (command line) running inside the container. Technically, the **-it** switch puts you inside a running container.  

    >Note:Please be patient as it will take a minute or so for this command to work. The "**it**" switch provides you with an interactive session. The '**CMD'** is a parameter passed as an argument which basically gives you access to the CMD (command line) running inside the container. Technically, the "**it**" switch puts you inside a running container.

    ![](content/image7.png)

1. Run the command `hostname`. This time you are running it inside the running container. Notice that the host name is different from the host name you get in step 5. The host name you see inside the container is the host name of the container itself. It is based on the container ID. You may want to run other commands as you wish or checkout the filesystem that is independent from the host's filesystem. 

    ![](content/image8.png)

1. Finally, exit the interactive session by typing `exit` and pressing **Enter**. This will take you back to the PowerShell console on the host.  

    ![](content/image9.png)

1.  Now let's run another container based on **Nano Server** image ( **mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver**). To do that run the command `docker run -it mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809 CMD` 
    >Note:It might take a few seconds to load. This time we are starting a Windows Command prompt instead of Powershell inside of the container)  
 
    ![](content/image10.png)  

1.  Run the command `hostname`. Notice that the host name is different from host name you get in the previous steps. Again, the host name you see inside the container is the host name of the container itself, which is based on the container id. You can run other commands as you wish.  

    ![](content/image11.png)

1.  Finally, exit the interactive session by typing `exit` and pressing **Enter**. This will take you back to the PowerShell console on the host.  


### Congratulations!

In this exercise, you have created and run containers based on the Windows Server Core & Nano Server container images that Microsoft provides and maintains. You have successfully completed this exercise. Click **Next** to advance to the next exercise.


# Exercise 2: Building and Running an IIS Server Windows Container Image

In the exercise you will learn how to install IIS Web Server (Web Server Role) on a Windows Server Core base core image. IIS Server is a popular Web Server released by Microsoft. Considering the strong footprint of IIS within enterprises, Microsoft supports IIS on Windows Server Core.


[Return to list of exercises](#module-2-table-of-contents) - [Return to list of modules](#modules)  
# Build and run an IIS Server Image

1. Make sure you have a PowerShell Console open as an administrator (if you have followed previous task you should already be running a Console). Also, change the current directory to "**iis**" by running the command `cd c:\labs\module2\iis\ `

    ![](content/image12.png)

1. The iis folder contains the Dockerfile with instructions to install IIS Server (Web Server Role) on the Windows Server Core base image. Display the Dockerfile by running the command `cat .\Dockerfile`

    ![](content/image13.png)

    - The **FROM** instruction points to the **mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore** to be used as a base image for the new container image
    - The **RUN** instruction executes PowerShell to install Windows Feature "Web Server" (IIS Server)
    - The next command is the **ADD** instruction which copies the **ServiceMonitor.exe** utility to the container image. The **ServiceMonitor.exe** is a utility that monitors **w3svc** service inside the container, if the service fails, the exe fails, so Docker knows the container is unhealthy. The **ServiceMonitor.exe** is developed and released by Microsoft (<https://github.com/microsoft/iis-docker/tree/master/windowsservercore-ltsc2019)>
    - The **EXPOSE** instruction does not actually publish the port. It functions as a type of documentation between the person who builds the image and the person who runs the container, about which ports are intended to be published.    
    - The **ENTRYPOINT** instruction makes sure that monitoring of **w3svc** begins immediately as soon as container starts running. This is what will keep the container in running state. 

1. To build the new image with IIS installed on it, run the command `docker build -t myiis:v1 .`. This command builds a new container image with name **myiis** and tag **v1**. The tag conveniently tells everyone information pertaining to the version of the image. 
    >Note: **STEP 3/6** of the build process performs the installation of the Web-Server (IIS Server) and may take few minutes. Eventually you should see the results as follow. 

    ![](content/image15.png)

1. Run a new container based on **myiis:v1** image by using the command: `docker run -d -p 8099:80 myiis:v1`

    ![](content/image16.png)

1. The full container ID is shown after the run command (**d83** in the above screenshot), or can be obtained by using `docker ps`

1.    To get the IP address of the container, run the following command:  
`start http://localhost:8099`
 
1. Open any web browser of your choice and browse to the IP address from the previous step.  
 
    ![](content/image18.png)  

    >Note: You can get the container's IP address of the container with **docker inspect** command as follow: **docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress}} ' containerid **. When accessing the container using it's IP Address you would use the port the container is listening on (port 80 in this case)

### Congratulations!

This concludes the exercise on creating a new image with IIS server. If you are looking to leverage IIS server beyond this lab, then you
may want to use Microsoft official IIS server image (**mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis**) which is available at (<https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/iis/)>. The underlying process is pretty much same but the main benefit of using the official IIS image is that Microsoft releases updated images on a regular basis including patches and fixes.

# Exercise 3: Building and running an ASP.NET 4.7 application in a container

In this task, you will learn how to package an existing ASP.NET 4.7 web application into a container. It's important to understand that Microsoft supports both the latest .NET frameworks like .NET Core, ASP.NET Core etc. as well as more legacy .NET Frameworks like .NET 3.5, .NET 4.5 and ASP.NET 4.5 on Windows Containers. Most customers today have critical workloads that depend on some legacy Microsoft technologies, therefore Microsoft provides a path for application containerization for legacy applications in addition to more modern apps.

>Knowledge: You can find more comprehensive list of application frameworks supported by Microsoft on Windows Containers at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/samples#Application-Frameworks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/samples#Application-Frameworks)


[Return to list of exercises](#module-2-table-of-contents) - [Return to list of modules](#modules)  
## Build and run an ASP.NET 4.7 MVC application

1.  Make sure you have a PowerShell console open as an administrator (if you have followed previous task you should already be running a console). Also, change the current directory to **aspnet 4.7** by running the command `cd C:\labs\module2\aspnet4.7\ `   
    
    ![](content/image19.png)  

1. Before proceeding further, let's stop and remove all the running containers from previous task. Run the command  `docker rm -f (docker ps -aq)`
 
    ![](content/image20.png)  

1. Let's examine the Dockerfile. Display its content by running the command `cat .\Dockerfile` 
    
    ![](content/image22.png)  
 
    - The first noticeable statements are the two **FROM** statements which are used in what is called, a **multi-staged build** process. It allows us to create two Docker images with a single **docker build** command
    - The first image is built on top of the .NET 4.7 SDK base image containing all utilities necessary to build your application: **mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/sdk:4.7.2-windowsservercore-ltsc2019**. This resulting image will be much bigger than what is required to simply run your application. This build stage will produce all application artifacts that will be picked up when building the second image. They will be copied in the folder **/app/WebAppLegacy** of the first image. Also note that this first image is identified as **build**   
    - The second image is built on top the .NET 4.7 runtime base image and only contains what is needed to run the application: **mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:4.7.2-windowsservercore-ltsc2019**. It uses the output from the first image to build its own runtime image **COPY --from=build /app/WebAppLegacy/. ./** . Keeping an image as small as possible is beneficial to reduce the attack surface (less tools equals less opportunities to exploit in an attack) and they will be much faster to download at deployment time.   

1.  Build a new image with web application packaged inside it by running the command  `docker build -t aspnetapp:v4.7 .`. Notice the tag **v4.7** that indicates the version of ASP.NET framework. The use of this tag is optional but recommended.      

    >Note: At the end of the build process, feel free to look at the produced images with **docker images**. You will see the two images that have been built, the SDK image (that is not named) and the image that is actually going to be hosting our application: **aspnetapp:v4.7**. We can automatically remove the SDK image once the runtime image is built. For that, use the **--rm** parameter in the **docker build** command   

1. To run a container with the ASP.NET 4.7 web application based on the container image we just built, run the command: `docker run -d -p 8088:80 aspnetapp:v4.7`
 
    ![](content/image24.png)  

1. Start your default browser and connect to the web site running in the container using the port mapped from the host (8088) : `start http://localhost:8088`
 
    
    
    ![](content/image26.png)  


### Congratulations!

You have successfully completed this exercise. Click **Next** to advance to the next exercise.



# Exercise 4: Building an ASP.NET Core application

In the previous task, you built container images using some of the more mature technologies and products released by Microsoft. In this task,
you will build container that will run ASP.NET Core Web Application. If you completed the Module 1 lab, this will be very similar. However, we will now build the Core application on Windows instead of Linux. Furthermore, we will use the multi-stage build process rather than building the application manually with **dotnet** CLI.  

ASP.NET Core is a significant step forward for Microsoft to allow ASP.NET to run across platforms including MacOS, Linux and Windows.
ASP.NET sits on top of .NET Core, so it also offers cross-platform support. 

>Note: To understand when to use .NET Core and when to use .NET Framework please read article: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard/choosing-core-framework-server>  

In this exercise, you will package a simple ASP.NET Core MVC application into a container image using a Dockerfile. Finally, you will run container hosting the ASP.NET Core application using the **docker run** command.

# Building and Running ASP.NET Core 3.x Application Inside Container

1.  Change to the relevant directory using the following command: `cd C:\labs\module2\aspnetcore`  

    ![](content/image53.png)  

1.  You are provided with a Dockerfile. View the content of the Dockerfile by running the command `cat .\Dockerfile`. The Dockerfile should look like the one below (note this is a multi-stage Dockerfile just like the .NET 4.7 example). 

    ![](content/image54_2.PNG)

1.  To create the container image run the command `docker build -t aspnetcoreapp:3.1 .` 

    >Note: Notice the use of tag **3.1** that signifies the dotnet core 3.1 framework version

1.  Launch the container running the app inside it by running the command `docker run -d -p 9000:80 aspnetcoreapp:3.1` 
 
    ![](content/image56_2.PNG) 

1.  You are now running ASP.NET Core application inside the container listening on the port 80 which is mapped to port 9000 on the host.

1. To see the ASP.NET Core web application in action open the web browser and navigate to **localhost** port **9000** `start http://localhost:9000 `. This will take you to the Home page of the Web Application.  
 
    ![](content/image58_3.png)

1. Run the following command to stop and remove all containers: `docker stop (docker ps -aq) ; docker rm (docker ps -aq)`.

# Exercise 1: Working with Data Volumes

In this exercise, you will learn how to mount a host directory as a data volume. The host directory will be available inside the container along with all the files (and sub directories). Later you will update a file on the host shared through a data volume from within the container. Remember that by default, data volumes at the time of mounting are read/write (unless you choose to only enable them for read only access).  
  
Docker containers, by design, are volatile when it comes to data persistence. This means that if you remove a container, for example, using docker "rm command, all the data that was in the container (running or stopped) with be lost. This certainly causes a challenge for applications that are running in the container and need to manage state. A good example here would be a SQL Server Database file from a previous lab that is required to be persisted beyond the life of the container running the SQL engine. The solution to this problem is to use data volumes. Data volumes are designed to persist data, independent of the container's lifecycle.  
  
Volumes are initialized when a container is created. Some of the key characteristics of volumes are listed below:   
  
  - Data volumes can be shared and reused among containers.  
  
  - Changes to a data volume are made directly by the container or the host.   
  
  - Data volumes persist even if the container itself is deleted.  

>Knowledge:Docker never automatically deletes volumes when you remove a container nor will it "garbage collect" volumes that are no longer referenced by a container. This means you are responsible for cleaning up volumes yourself.

# Mount a host directory as a data volume

1. You will need to run the commands in this section using the PowerShell console as an administrator. Right click the **PowerShell** icon on the taskbar and select **Run as Administrator**.

    ![](content/media/image3.png)

1. Navigate to your C:\\ drive: `cd C:\\`
 
1. Create a directory on the host operating system and then add a plain text file to it. Create a new directory on the C drive by running the command `mkdir MyData`

    ![](content/media/image59.png)

1.  Display the contents of the folder you just created in previous step by running the command `ls MyData`. It is currently empty.  

1. You are now ready to run a container in the interactive mode and mount the host directory as a data volume. Run the command 
`docker run -it -v C:/MyData/:C:/Data/ mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809 CMD`

    ![](content/mod3image7.png)

    >Knowledge: Notice the **-v** switch that is required to mount the host directory **C:\MyData** inside the container as **C:\Data**. This will result in container access to contents of **C:\MyData** on the host inside the container as **C:\Data**. You can choose same name for the directory inside the container and host but it's not mandatory as you see in the above command (**C:\MyData** on the host and **C:\Data** inside the container)

1. On the container PowerShell Console first check the hostname by running the command `hostname`. 
    >Note:The actual hostname for your container may be different than pictured below. Most importantly though, the container hostname will be different from you VM hostname.

    ![](content/media/image64.png)

1. List the directories by running the command `dir`. 
    >Note:Notice the **data** directory as part of the listing.

    ![](content/media/image65.png)

1. Create a file in the folder and add more text to it. Run the command: `echo File is updated by container: %COMPUTERNAME% >> c:\data\file.txt`
    
    ![](content/mod3image12.png)

    >Note: **%COMPUTERNAME%** is equivalent to **hostname** 

1. You can access and update the content of the data directory. First, run the command `dir c:\data`
    
    >Knowledge: This will list the content structure residing inside the data directory. 

    >Note:Notice **file.txt** is present inside the data directory. This is the same file you created earlier on the host.

    ![](content/media/image66.png)

1. Look at content inside the **file.txt** by running the command `more c:\data\file.txt`

    ![](content/mod3image11.png)

1. You can now exit the container and return to host by running the command `exit`

    ![](content/media/image70.png)

1. On the host PowerShell Console run the command `gc C:\MyData\file.txt`. gc stands for **Get-Content**.
   
    >Note:Notice that changes made from the container persist on the host by the **file.txt**.

    ![](content/media/image71.png)

1. Run `docker ps -a` to get the ID of stopped containers, and then record the container ID in the following text box: 

    **Container ID**  
    @lab.TextBox(ContainerID2)

    >Note:To gather more information about container and volumes that has been mounted you can run the command `docker inspect <ContainerID2>`.

    ![](content/media/image72.png)

1. The docker inspect command outputs a rather large JSON file on the display. You may need to scroll down to find the section labeled "Mounts". 
    >Note:Notice that **c:\\mydata** is the source and **c:\\data** is the destination. Also, RW refers to Read/Write.

    ![](content/media/image73.png)

1. Let's run another container in interactive mode and mount the host directory as a data volume. Run the command `docker run -it -v C:/MyData/:C:/Data/ mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809 Cmd` 
 
    ![](content/mod3image7.png)

1. Look at content inside the **file.txt** by running the command `more c:\data\file.txt`    

    ![](content/mod3image11.png)

1. Add more text to it. Run the command: `echo File is updated by container: %COMPUTERNAME% >> c:\data\file.txt`  

1. On the host machine, go to **C:\MyData** from the file explorer and open **file.txt**  

    ![](content/image11_hostread.png)
    
1. Update the content of the file with notepad and save it.  

    ![](content/image11_hostupdate.png)

    >Note: The two different **hostnames** correspond to the two Ids of the containers that wrote in the file.     

1. Go back to the Powershell windows and check that the container can see the host changes with the command `more c:\data\file.txt`
    
    ![](content/image11_containerseeupdate.png)

    >Note: Because of concurrency challenges, you would probably not have multiple containers and hosts writing in the same file. The purpose of this exercise was only to show how we can persistent data across containers beyond their short lifecycle.  

1. Finally, you can run `exit` to stop the running containers  


# Mount a shared-storage volume as a data volume

In the previous section you learn how to mount a directory on the host as a data volume. That's a very handy way to share the content from host to container but it's not ideal in terms of portability. Basically, if you later run the container on a different host there is no guarantee that host will have the same directory. This would cause the app inside the container to break as it depends on a share that is not implemented by the host. In cases like these when a higher level of portability is desired, you can mount a *shared storage volume*. Docker has some volume plugins that allow you to provision and mount shared storage, such as iSCSI, NFS, or FC. A benefit of using shared volumes is that they are host-independent. This means that a volume can be made available on any host on which a container is started as long as the container has access to the shared storage backend, and has the plugin installed.

In this exercise, you will learn how to create and use a shared-storage volume. To keep the lab accessible and easy to follow, you will use the *local* driver which uses local host for the storage. However, the exact same concepts will work against production ready storage drivers like Convoy and others. For more information on the Convoy volume plugin, please visit: [https://github.com/rancher/convoy](https://github.com/rancher/convoy)

1.  First, let's create a volume by running the command following command from a Powershell window `docker volume create -d local myvolume`

    ![](content/media/image75.png)  

1. You can list all the volumes by running the command `docker volume ls`. Notice that **myvolume** is available as a local driver.  
    
    ![](content/media/image76.png)

1. You can use **docker inspect** command with the volumes too. Run the command `docker inspect myvolume`

    ![](content/mod3image21.png)
  
    >Note: **Mountpoint** is set at a location on the **C** drive under the **ProgramData\docker** folder. This is the default location for local storage drivers. If you use another commercial storage driver,
the location may be different. 

1. To launch a container and make that storage volume available inside the container run the command `docker run -it -v myvolume:C:/Data/ mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:1809 powershell`. This command is like the command from last section where you shared the host directory, except that within the **-v** switch you are using the name of the storage volume rather than the path to the host directory. 

1. On the PowerShell command prompt inside the container, run the command `dir` to list the directories available in the container.  
 
    ![](content/mod3image23.png)

1. Notice the data directory. You can now add/remove files to it. Let's create a new text file and add text content to it. On the command prompt run the command `"File created on the host: $(hostname)" >> c:\data\sample.txt`.

    ![](content/mod3image24.png) 

1. Confirm that file sample.txt has been created successfully by running the command `more c:\data\sample.txt`  
 
    ![](content/mod3image25.png)  

1. Now exit the container by running the command `exit`. This will take you back to PowerShell console on the host.  

1. To check the content of sample.txt file from the host run the command `gc C:\\ProgramData\\docker\\volumes\\myvolume\\\_data\sample.txt`.

# Exercise 2: Working with Docker-Compose

##Challenges with Multi-Container Applications

When working with multi-containers applications, you will need to make sure that applications can discover each other in a seamless fashion. Consider a quite common scenario where a web application (that acts as a front-end) calls to a backend RESTful web API to fetch content. In this scenario, the web app would need to access the web API in a consistent fashion. In addition, due to the fact the web application has a dependency on the web API, that dependency must be expressed when launching the applications in containers. It is imperative that we are able to launch and test a multi-container application the same way across development, test and production environments.

Docker has provided a tool called **"docker-compose"** that enables you to describe your applications as services within a YAML file, docker-compose.yml. A service in this context really means, "a container in production". A service only runs one image, but it codifies the way that image runs - what ports it should use, how many replicas of the container image should run (so that the service has the capacity it needs), and so on. Scaling a service increases the number of container instances running the application image, assigning more computing resources to that service in the process.

##Working with Docker-Compose

In this exercise, you will work with a simple "Famous Quotes" application that is composed of a frontend web app that talks to a RESTful API to fetch quotes in JSON format. Both the web app and API are developed using ASP.NET Core and each will run in a separate container. As this is a multi-container scenario, you will use a docker-compose file to:

- Ensure the web API can be accessed by the web app without the need to hardcode its FDQN or IP Address. Instead of hardcoding the IP Address (or FDQN) you can use a docker-compose.yml file to make these services discoverable

    >Note: Recall from the previous lab where a web application needed to access SQL Server running in a separate container. In that situation, we provided the web application the IP Address of the container running SQL Server in the web.config configuration file.  

- Express specific dependencies, such as the web app container **depends on** the web API container

- Get both application components up and running in separate containers with a single command (i.e., without using individual docker-run commands for each container).

# Running Multi-Container applications using Docker Compose

1. Launch the **PowerShell Console** (if not already running) and change your current directory to "**compose**" folder by running the command `cd C:\labs\module3\compose`

    ![](content/media/image83.png)

1. Before proceeding further let's stop all the running containers from previous task. Run the command `docker stop (docker ps -aq)`

    ![](content/media/image84.png)

1. First, look at directory structure by running the command `dir`.

    ![](content/media/image85.png)

1. Notice that you have two folders "**mywebapi**" and "**mywebapp**" representing the web API and web application, respectively. First, you will inspect the piece of code that is making the RESTful call to mywebapi. To do that run the command: `gc .\mywebapp\Controllers\HomeController.cs`

    ![](content/media/image86.png)

1. This displays the code within HomeController.cs file. You may need to scroll down to view the code that calls the mywebapi RESTful endpoint. The actual URI is [http://demowebapi:9000/api/quotes](http://demowebapi:9000/api/quotes). 

    >Note:Notice the use of **demowebapi** which is not a FQDN nor IP Address, but rather a service that is defined within the **docker-compose.yml** file (which we will review next). By using the service name, the web application can simply refer to the Web API app (using that same name) across all environments, including development, test and production etc.

    ![](content/media/image87.png)

1. Let's inspect the **docker-compose.yml** file. Run the command `gc .\docker-compose.yml`

    ![](content/media/image88.png)

    ![](content/image89_2.PNG)

    >Knowledge: First, notice the structure of the file. All .YML files follow the YAML structure (more information about the extension can be found at <https://www.reviversoft.com/file-extensions/yml>. For docker compose usage you first define the version number and then specify the structure of your services. In this case, we have two services, namely "*demowebapp*" and "*demowebapi*". The demowebapp service declaration starts with the build instruction and points to folder "*mywebapp*" that contains the ASP.NET core application and relevant Dockerfile (recall the file entitled, DockerFile, that resides in the root of the application). Note how the compose file contains sections, or "instructions": Services, networks, etc. The build instruction is equal to the *docker build* command. Then ports are mapped from the host's port 80 to the container's port 80.The *depends\_on* directs the docker-compose to launch the *demowebapi* container first since *demowebapp* depends on it. Also, the discoverability is done by using the service names (as mentioned in the paragraph above whereas, *demowebapp* can access *demowebapi* by its service name, rather than FDQN or IP Address).
    >
    >Next is the *demowebapi* service declaration. It also starts with the build command pointing to the "mywebapi" folder that contains the Dockerfile and relevant ASP.NET Core files. Ports are mapped from host port 9000 to container port 9000.
    >
    >Finally, the networks section keeps the default settings to nat networking. This network declaration is needed for windows containers now. Basically, it tells docker compose to use default nat networking.

# Docker Compose Up

1. We have pre-downloaded the docker-compose.exe file for you onto the VM, if you would like to see it, you can see the URL here: **https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.12.0/docker-compose-Windows-x86\_64.exe**  

1. At this point, you are all set to run the multi-container application with a single command `docker-compose.exe up -d`

    ![](content/media/image90.png)

    >Knowledge: The docker-compose.exe tries to make it simple to start and stop the services (running containers) with commands like up and down. The **-d** switch works the same as when used with the docker build command, which instructs docker to run the container in the background rather than interactively. If you don't provide any switch parameter, the default is set to interactive.

    >Note:As the command executes, you will notice that the "mywebapi" container is built first. This is because we mention in the yml file that "mywebapp" depends on it, so it will build first. Also, if the image for "mywebapi" already exists, then it won't be built again.

    ![](content/mod3image35_2.PNG)

    >Note:Next, Docker will build the container image for "mywebapp."

    ![](content/mod3image36_2.PNG)

    >Note:You can safely ignore any warnings.

1. Finally, docker-compose will run both containers using the instructions from the docker-compose.yml file.

    ![](content/media/image93.png)

1. You can check details about running docker cmpose services by executing the command `docker-compose ps`

    ![](content/image94_3.png)

1. Open web browser of your choice and browse to localhost `start http://localhost`. You should land on the home page of web application as shown below.

    ![](content/mod3image40_3.png)

    >Note:To test the Web API you will can select the **Quotes** option from the top menu bar. This will result in a call to web API and results being displayed on the web application.

    ![](content/image97_2.PNG)

# Docker Compose Down

When you wish to stop and remove the multi-container application that was launched by docker compose, you will use docker-compose down command. The down command safely stops and removes all the containers that were launched by the up command earlier using the docker-compose.yml file.

>Knowledge: If you only wish to stop the multi-container applications and associated running containers use "**docker-compose stop**" command instead. This command will stop the containers, but won't remove them.


[Return to list of exercises](#module-3-table-of-contents) - [Return to list of modules](#modules)  
1. On the PowerShell console run the command `docker-compose down`

    >Note: First the containers are stopped and then they are removed.

# Exercise 3: Docker Networking

In this exercise, you will work with various PowerShell and Docker CLI commands to view Docker default networks and create a custom nat network. Finally, you will remove the custom nat network and observe how Docker responds by creating a new default nat network automatically.


[Return to list of exercises](#module-3-table-of-contents) - [Return to list of modules](#modules)  
# Display all Docker networks

You can retrieve container networks using the Docker CLI.

1. Docker provides native docker command that provides list of networks available to docker. To view the list of networks available to docker run the command `docker network ls`.

    ![](content/mod3image43.png)

    >Knowledge: The 'nat' network is the default network for containers running on Windows. Any containers that are run on Windows without any flags or arguments to implement specific network configurations will be attached to the default 'nat' network, and automatically assigned an IP address from the 'nat' network's internal prefix IP range. The default nat network also supports port forwarding from container host to internal containers. For example, you can simply run SQL Server Express in a container by providing the "p" flag so that specified port numbers will be mapped from host to container.

1. To view detail information about the Docker default nat network, run the command `docker inspect nat`

    >Note:Notice the output is in JSON format. The "Containers" key (which is empty in this case) refers to all containers that are using the specified network. The containers key is empty in this case because there are no containers currently running.

    ![](content/mod3image44.png)

1. Run `ipconfig` to see the two networks: the physical network, localdomain, and the local container network, nat.

    ![](content/mod3image44_localnetwork.png)

1. Launch a new container by running a command `docker run -d mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809 ping -t localhost**+++. Once the container is running execute the command +++**docker inspect nat`

    >Note:Notice that this time the "Containers" section now includes information pertaining to the container that is using the nat network including its ID and IPv4 address.

    ![](content/mod3image45.png)

# Create a custom Docker nat network

Docker allows you to create custom nat networks. In this task, you will create and configure a custom nat network replacing the default nat network.

  
[Return to list of exercises](#module-3-table-of-contents) - [Return to list of modules](#modules)  
1. Create a new docker network by running the command `docker network create -d nat --subnet=192.168.15.0/24 --gateway=192.168.15.1 custom-nat`

    >Note:The **"d"** flag stands for network driver and specifies the network type you want to create which in this case is "nat". You are also providing the IP prefix and gateway address using the -subnet and -gateway flags.

1. Use the **+++docker network ls**+++ command and notice that "**custom-nat**" network is available.

    ![](content/mod3image48.png)

1. To use the new custom nat network for containers launch a new container by using the command `docker run -d --network=custom-nat mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809 ping -t localhost`

    >Note:Notice the use of --network switch which allows you to force docker to use specific network for the container.

1. Now, use the **+++docker network inspect custom-nat**+++ command to get the detailed information about custom-nat network and container(s) that is using it.

    >Note:Notice the subnet and gateway values reflect the values you used earlier during the creation of the network. Also note that the container's IPv4 Address, 192.168.15.224 (may be different in your case), is in the custom-nat network.

    ![](content/mod3image49.png)

1. To confirm that the container host and access container run the command `ping &lt;Container - IPv4 Address&gt;`
    
    >Note: You can look for container's IP Address in the output from previous command. Notice that the host can successfully access the container using its IP.

    ![](content/mod3image50.png)
 
1. Now let's start a new container on the nat network and open a command prompt `docker run -it --network=nat mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:1809 cmd`

1. We can try to ping the previous container with `ping <Container - IPv4 Address>` where the IP Address is the same one we just pinged from the host.  Hit **Ctrl-C** to stop the ping operation.

    ![](content/image50_pingFromContainer.png)

    >Note: Because the two containers are on separated networks, they cannot ping each other using their IP Address.     

1.  Run `ipconfig**+++ from the container to check the that IP Address belongs to the nat network. Then run +++**exit` to go back to the host.    
  
    ![](content/image50_containerIp.png)

1. Remove all containers so that you can then remove the custom network you have created (if containers are still attached to the network, the network deletion will fail). `docker rm (docker ps -aq) -f`

1.  You may now remove the **custom-nat** network `docker network rm custom-nat`

    ![](content/image50_rmCustomNetwork.png)

1.  Check that only nat network remains `docker network ls`  
    
    ![](content/mod3image51.png)

# Exercise 4: Running containers with memory and CPU constraints

By default, when a container is run, it has no resource constraints. Without constraints, a container can use as much of a given resource as the host's kernel scheduler will allow. Docker enables you to control how much memory, CPU, and/or block IO a container can consume by setting runtime configuration flags. In this exercise, you will run a container with resource constraints. To follow best practices, you should always establish resource constraints on your containers.


[Return to list of exercises](#module-3-table-of-contents) - [Return to list of modules](#modules)  
# Run a container with memory constraints  

In this task, you will launch a container with a pre-defined memory limit, to ensure the container does not consume the host's memory beyond the memory limit. Later, you will test the container memory limit by simulating higher memory consumption inside the container.


[Return to list of exercises](#module-3-table-of-contents) - [Return to list of modules](#modules)  
1. Before running the container open two new **PowerShell** Consoles
    >Note:You will use one of these consoles to run the docker container and interact with it. The other console will be leveraged to monitor the memory usage of the container.

1. Use one of the open **PowerShell** consoles to launch a new container with a memory limit of 500 megabytes (MB) by running the command `docker run -it -m 500M --mount 'type=bind,source=C:/labs/module3/tools/,target=C:/tools/' mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:1809 powershell`

    >Note:Notice the use of -m (or --memory) switch within the run command. The switch specifies the maximum amount of memory the container can use. In this case, you are setting it to 500 M (where M = Megabytes). Other valid options are B = Bytes, K= Kilobytes and G = Gigabytes. These are also not case sensitive).

    >Knowledge:The use of -m switch is not related to memory but rather to bind mounting the tools folder on from the host into the container. This folder containes a Sysinternals tool "[TestLimit64.exe](https://live.sysinternals.com/WindowsInternals/)" which you will be using next to test the container memory limit.

1. You should now have access to **PowerShell** console that is running inside the container. Run the `hostname` command and note the name of the container. You will need it later in this task.

    **Container ID**  
    @lab.TextBox(ContainerID3)

    ![](content/mod3image52.png)

1. To test the memory limit of container you will use the **testlimit** tool. Run the following command `C:\tools\testlimit64.exe -d -c 1024`

    ![](content/mod3image53.png)

    >Note:The tool will attempt to push the memory consumption of the container to 1024 MB (1 GB). However,because the container can't go beyond 500 MB, the value of memory consumed will always be under 500 MB (the exact value of how much memory is used will vary but won't go beyond the maximum available memory on container which is 500 MB)

1. Go back to the **PowerShell** console on the host (this is the second console that you opened earlier). Run the docker stats command `docker stats <ContainerID3>`

    >Note: This command gives you a live stream of various vital stats including memory, CPU, etc. directly from the container.

1. Notice the value under the column "**PRIV WORKING SET**". This represents the memory usage by the container; this is the value that docker has constrained to 500 MB.

    ![](content/mod3image54.png)

1. Now, you will reclaim the memory occupied by the running tool. Go back to the **PowerShell** console that was used to run the container and press the key combination "**Ctrl+C**". 
    >Note:This will stop the tool and free the memory on the container used by this tool.

1. Go back on the **PowerShell** console on the host that is displaying the vital stats for the container. 
    >Note:Notice that memory usage has dropped significantly.

    ![](content/mod3image55.png)

1. Hit "**Ctrl+C**" to stop the docker stats command

1. In the other **Powershell** window, type `exit` to exit the running container


# Run a container with a CPU usage limit

In addition to setting a memory constaint, you can also constrain the CPU usage by the container. By default,Docker does not apply any constraint on container CPU usage, which essentially means the container is free to utilize host CPU up to 100%. In this task, you will put a limit on CPU utilization by the container.


[Return to list of exercises](#module-3-table-of-contents) - [Return to list of modules](#modules)  

1. Since modern machines have CPUs with multiple cores you will first determine the number of cores available to the host virtual machine by running the command `Get-WmiObject â€“class Win32_processor | Select -ExpandProperty NumberOfCores`

    >Note:Take note of the number of cores available. In this case there are 2 cores, but the value you see may differ.
    
    ![](content/mod3image56.png)

1. You will now launch a new container and limit its host CPU utilization to ~25%. Make sure that you set half of the availble CPU here. If your machine just has 4 cores, set the value to 1. 

    `docker run -it --cpus 1.0 --mount 'type=bind,source=C:/labs/module3/tools/,target=C:/tools/' mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:1809 powershell`

    >Note:Notice the use of --cpus switch which will specify how much of the available CPU resources the container can use. For example, the host machine has two CPUs and if you set --cpus to 1.0, the container will be able to access, **at most**, one of the CPUs on the host.


1. You should now have access to PowerShell console that is running inside of the container. Run the `hostname` command and take note of the container name. You will need it later in this task. 

    **Container hostname**
    @lab.TextBox(ContainerID4)

1. Go back to the **PowerShell** console on the host (this is the second console that you opened earlier). Run the docker stats command `docker stats <ContainerID4>`

    ![](content/mod3image57.png)

1. Go back to the **PowerShell** console in the container and make sure that you are authorized to run PS1 scripts by running the following command `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`

1. You will now test the CPU constraint of ~25% by stress testing the CPU utilization on the container. Switch back to the **PowerShell** console that you used earlier to launch the container with a CPU usage limit. Execute the command `C:\tools\cpu-stress.ps1`

    ![](content/mod3image58.png)

    >Note:This command executes the script on the container which stress tests CPU, targeting all cores available to the container. However, because you set a constraint on CPU utilization, the container will never able to consume more than 1 CPU.To validate the CPU usage, go back to PowerShell console displaying **docker stats**. Notice the container CPU utilization is ~25% and not 100%. The CPU utilization may be slightly lower or higher than 25%, so it may not be exact.

# Exercise 1: Create and Scale Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster

In this exercise, you will create a Kubernetes cluster using Azure Kubernetes Service and deploy a NGINX container image to that cluster. The container image will be pulled from the Docker Hub public registry. You will also learn how the application can be scaled via the command line.


[Return to list of exercises](#module-3-table-of-contents) - [Return to list of modules](#modules)  

1. Navigate to +++@lab.CloudPortal.Url+++ and sign in with your **Azure** account credentials found on the Resource Tab.
    
    +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++
    
    +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password+++

1. On your Windows server VM, open **PowerShell**. 

    >Note:  Do not use Powershell ISE, as the IDE won't work as expected with the **az** CLI

1. Login to **Azure** using `az login`

    >Note:The command line will automatically open your browser to login. Once you are logged in, you can close the browser and return to the command line.

1. If you have multiple subscriptions attached to your account, you will see a list of them displayed post-login. To select the correct subscription, put the name of the subscription in quotes. You can find the **name** field in the output of the **az login** command executed above

    ![](content/mod5image28.png)

    Record the subscription name in the following text box:

    **Subscription Name**   
    @lab.TextBox(SubscriptionName)

    Now run the following command: 

    `az account set --subscription "<SubscriptionName>"`

1. Get the Resource Group Name for your Labs

    **Resource Group Name** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;++@lab.CloudResourceGroup(containerswrkshp).Name++

    @lab.TextBox(resource_group_name)

    > [!hint] The resource group name can be found on the **Resources** tab

    ![](content/getresourcegroupname.jpg)

    > [!help] Expand the next section **ONLY IF** you are using your own Azure Subscription and NOT the one provided in the Lab

    <details>
    <summary>Click to expand **only if** you are using you own Azure subscription</summary>

    Run the following command to create a resource group: 

     ```az group create --name=<resource_group_name> --location=eastus ```

    </details>


1. Once the resource group is created, deploy a **Kubernetes cluster** using AKS! 

    `az aks create --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name aks-k8s-cluster --disable-rbac --node-count 2 --generate-ssh-keys --network-plugin azure`

    >Note:Note that this command will generate public/private ssh keys in **c:\\users\\Administrator\\.ssh** folder.

    >Alert:It can take up to 10 minutes for the cluster to provision successfully in the US. If you are located in Europe, the provisioning can take up to 30 minutes.

1. After the cluster is provisioned successfully you will be shown **JSON** output describing the **AKS cluster**.

1. Locate and copy the value of "**fdqn**" attribute from the **JSON** output. 
    >Note:Note that your fdqn value may differ from the output shown below.

    ![](content/media/image116.png)

1. Run the following command to download the Kubernetes cluster configuration to the local config file **C:\\users\\Administrator\\.kube\\config**. 

    `az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name aks-k8s-cluster`

    >[!help]Be aware that you will need the contents of the **.kube/config** file when you create a Kubernetes service endpoint on Azure DevOps in the DevOps module.

1. Run following command to ensure context is set to the correct cluster:

    `kubectl config set-context aks-k8s-cluster`

1. You will now test the cluster by running a nginx container. First create a new deployment using the following command: 

    `kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx`

1. Next, make sure that you can access the container from the external (public IP). To do that use the expose command to expose port 80 and enable the external IP (type=LoadBalancer). It is going to expose a Kubernetes service through the Azure Load Balancer deployed as part of the AKS cluster. The Kubernetes service will redirect traffic to the deployment we just created:

    `kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer`

1. The above command creates a service with the name nginx. You can view the service by running following command 

    +++**kubectl get service nginx+++**

    ![](content/mod5image2.png)

    >Note:Please wait until **EXTERNAL-IP** for the **nginx** service change from **&lt;pending&gt;** to a valid IP address. It may take few minutes and you may have to run the command `kubectl get service nginx` a few times to probe the status of external IP assignment. Another useful parameter is **-w** that can be added to the command to watch as the service output changes. When it is done, it will look like below:

    ![](content/mod5image3.png)


1. You can now simply query the content hosted by nginx using the curl command: `start http://$( kubectl get service nginx -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].ip}')`

1. Let's check total number of pods running now. You should see one pod ready with a status of running. 

    >Note:When using **kubectl create**, deployments are created with a single pod by default. 

    `kubectl get pods`

1. You will now scale the number of pods using a replica set. You can get more details about the replica set using the following command:

    `kubectl get replicaset`

1. To scale, run the command and pass the name of deployment that was created earlier 

    `kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=3`

1. Now, run the following command to view the number of running pods (Expected result is that the number has scaled from 2 to 3). 

    `kubectl get pods -o wide`

1. In a previous step, you successfully increased the number of pods by increasing the replica set. However, all the pods are running on two nodes. You can check that by running the following command 

    `kubectl get nodes`

    In addition to the number of pods, we might want to adjust the compute capacity of the cluster itself. For instance, to remove one worker node from the cluster, we can run the following command:

    `az aks scale --node-count=1 --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name aks-k8s-cluster`

    >Note:Please wait while the worker node is successfully removed from the cluster. This may take few minutes to complete.

1. If you check the number of nodes again, you should see a single worker node running in the cluster. You can independently adjust the number of pods and number of working nodes in a cluster. You can also look at the maximum pod capacity of a node by running the command: 

    `kubectl get node NODE-NAME -o=jsonpath='{.status.capacity.pods}'`

1. To scale back down to a node count of 2, run the following command:

    `az aks scale --node-count=2 --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name aks-k8s-cluster`

1. Finally, remove the deployment and service using the commands below:

    `kubectl delete deployment nginx; kubectl delete service nginx`

1. Do not delete your AKS cluster in the Azure Portal, you will need the cluster for the CI/CD portion in the next module.

# Exercise 2: Create a Windows Node Pool

In this exercise, you will add an additional node pool to your Azure Kubernetes Cluster (AKS) that will allow you to run Windows Server containers. The default node pool in AKS creates nodes running a Linux operating system and only allows linux containers. We will create an additional node pool using a Windows Server operating systems allowing you to run Windows containers. The container image will be fetched from the Docker Hub public registry.



[Return to list of exercises](#module-3-table-of-contents) - [Return to list of modules](#modules) 


1. On your Windows server VM, open PowerShell and past the following command to create a new Windows Server Node Pool

    >Alert: It may take approximately 10 minutes for the node pool to provision successfully in the US. If you are located in Europe, the provisioning may take longer.

    `az aks nodepool add --resource-group @lab.CloudResourceGroup(containerswrkshp).Name --cluster-name aks-k8s-cluster --os-type Windows --name npwin --node-count 2 --node-taints kubernetes.io/os=windows:NoSchedule`

    ![](content/M5E2-Image1a.png)

    >Knowledge: <h3>What does <b>--node-taints kubernetes.io/os=windows:NoSchedule</b> do?</h3>When a taint is applied to a node it means only pods with a declared toleration that matches can be scheduled on it. Therefore, in order to deploy a pod to the Windows Nodes you first have to add a **tolerations** section and **nodeSelector** to your YAML manifest (see below). Manifests for Linux pods do not need to be modified and will, by default, only deploy to Linux nodes. Without these restictions, Kubernetes will simply choose an available node and if it chooses the wrong operating system the Pod will fail to create.

1. Verify that your Kubernetes cluster has 2 Linux nodes and 2 Windows nodes

    `kubectl get nodes -o wide`

    ![](content/M5E2-Image2a.png)

    >Alert: At the time of this writing, AKS requires Windows containers to use images based on **Windows Server 2019 Build 1809** .


    When deploying Windows containers using a Kubernetes manifest file a [**toleration**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) and a [**node selector**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector "nodeSelector") must be defined to tell your AKS Cluster to deploy your containers to Nodes running Windows Server only. The **toleration** overrides the **taint** setup when the Node Pool was created and the **node selector** is usually accomplished by using the built-in label **kubernetes.io/os** with a value of **windows** (can also be linux)
    ```yaml-nocopy
spec:
	tolerations:
	- key: kubernetes.io/os
		operator: Equal
		value: windows
		effect: NoSchedule
	nodeSelector:
	  "beta.kubernetes.io/os": windows
    ```
1. Change to the c:\labs\module5 directory 

    +++cd c:\labs\module5+++

1. View the contents of the Kubernetes manifiest file **iis-demo.yaml**

    +++type .\iis-demo.yaml+++

    Notice the **tolerations** and **nodeSelector** sections needed to deploy to Windows Nodes.

    ![](content/M5E2-Image4b.png)

1. Deploy the Application and Load Balancer using the command 

    +++kubectl apply -f .\iis-demo.yaml+++

    >Note: It may take several minutes for the nodes to download the windows image before the pod status changes to **running** 

1. Wait for the application to deploy. Verify that EXTERNAL-IP is available for **service/iis-sample** and **deployment.apps/iis-demo** has **2** pods available

    +++kubectl get all+++

    ![](content/M5E2-Image5a.png)

1. launch the browser and verify that the default IIS landing page is shown

    +++start http://$( kubectl get service iis-sample -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].ip}')+++

    ![](content/M5E2-Image6a.png)

1. Cleanup resources by deleting the IIS Pod and Service
    
    +++kubectl delete -f .\iis-demo.yaml+++

# Exercise 2: Setup a project and Azure Container Registry (ACR)

In this exercise, you are going to complete the first phase of the CI/CD pipeline by pushing the code artifacts for the sample Web App and Web API to Azure Repository. You will also create an Azure Container Registry (ACR) to privately store the Web App and Web API Docker images.


[Return to list of exercises](#module-6-table-of-contents) - [Return to list of modules](#modules) 

# Examine and Build sample application in Visual Studio

1.  Navigate to **C:\labs\module6** [ +++cd C:\labs\module6;start devops.sln+++ ] within the Windows VM. Double click on the "devops" solution file which will open the project in Visual Studio. 
    
    ![](content/mod6image4.png)

1. On the right, you will see the **Solution Explorer**. You should see two ASP. NET Core applications, a Web API backend project and an MVC Core frontend project. 
  
    ![](content/mod6image5.png)

1. Open **HomeController.cs** in the **mywebapp** project, under the **Controllers** folder. You will see that the **frontend** application retrieves some quotes from the Web API. The URL to reach to the Web API is configured by the container orchestrator used. For example, in Kubernetes, this happens through Labels and Selectors, along with the use of Services. 
    
    ![](content/mod6image6.png)  

1. In the **Solution Items** folder, open the **backend-webapi.yaml** file which is the deployment configuration file for Kubernetes cluster. Notice that here the backend application is also exposed with the name **demowebapi**. 

    ![](content/mod6image7.png)

# Add solution to source control (Git and Azure Repository)

1. Open File Explorer and navigate to **C:\\labs\\module6**.

1. Right click choose **Git Bash Here**.

    ![](content/mod6image8.png)

1. Run the following commands, one at a time 
    
    >Note:You can either fill in a name and email or leave it as the default. The two **Git config** commands are a one-time setup. **Git init** will initialize your folder as a git repository and add an empty hidden **.git** folder. **Git add** and **commit** are necessary steps anytime you make a change to your code and want it to be staged (tracked and ready to be committed locally) and committed (ready to be pushed to the server)  

    `git config --global user.email &lt;you@example.com&gt;`  
    `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`  
    `git init`  
    `git add .`  
    `git commit -m 'adding my web project'`  

1. Navigate to https://dev.azure.com/**YourAccountName/YourProjectName** to see the environment.

    **YourAccountName is should be something like User1-xxxxxx** without @lodsasdoutlook.onmicrosoft.com

 A sample link is **https://dev.azure.com/User1-223423525/firstProject**

    ![](content/mod6image9.png)

1. Now you are ready to push your local Git repository to a remote repository in Azure DevOps. Navigate to your Code repository by clicking on **Repos - Files**. You will see that your Git repository is empty, as expected. In order to push your local code files into Azure DevOps, copy the commands under **"push an existing repository from command line"** 

    ![](content/mod6image10.png)

1. Paste them into Git Bash by pressing **Shift + Insert** (or right click and paste into the Git Bash command line). The first line will be run automatically; hit enter to run the second line. 

    >Knowledge: **Git remote add origin** means to add a "remote URL such as your Azure repo URL" with the alias **origin** to your local git settings for this project folder. You could name it any alias you want, **origin** is just the default. **Git push** means to interact with the server and push code to that URL you provided as origin. The **-u**" will "set-upstream" which means that it will default all pushes and pulls to the **origin** URL and you don't have to specify **origin** in all your future commands. 

    ![](content/mod6image11.png)

  You will see a popup to authenticate to your Microsoft account. Be sure to use your Lab Azure Account on the resources tab. Once authenticated, your project will be pushed to the remote Git repository in Azure DevOps. Return to Azure DevOps in the browser and refresh the page to see your code files populate **Repos - Files**. 
  
    ![](content/mod6image12.png)

# Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)

A critical component of the Containerized DevOps lifecycle is the container registry. The container registry allows you to store and manage your container images. You can leverage public registries such as Docker Hub or private registries either installed on-premise or hosted by a cloud provider. In this task, you are going to use Azure Container Registry to manage your Linux and Windows container images


[Return to list of exercises](#module-6-table-of-contents) - [Return to list of modules](#modules) 

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), click the **plus** icon to add a new resource. Type **"Container Registry"** in the search textbox and click on the result for **Container Registry**. 
 
    ![](content/mod6image13.png)

1. Click **Create**. 
    
    ![](content/mod6image14.png)

1.  Select a unique registry name and specify a resource group. Resource group should be prepopulated in the dropdown menu, so you can select it.  Leave everything else as default and click **Review + create**.

     ![](content/container-reg-v2.jpg)

1. Once the container registry deployment is validated, click **Create** to create the Azure container registry.

1. This proces might take few minutes to complete.  Once the container registry resource is created navigate to resource by clicking **Go to resource** button.

    ![](content/container-reg-go-to.jpg)

1. On this page navigate to **Access keys** section and enable the **Admin user**.  You will need these values to create a service connection for DevOps pipelines.

    ![](content/container-reg-enable-admin.png)
    
    >Note:For future reference, in order to enable features like geo-replication for managing a single registry across multiple regions, content trust for image tag signing, and firewalls and virtual networks (preview) to restrict access to the registry, you must use the Premium SKU.* 

1. You can now update your Kubernetes configuration files to use the proper container registry name. Go into Azure DevOps and hit the **Repos** \> **Files** tab. The files that you will need to be edited are: **backend-webapi.yaml, docker-compose.yml, and frontend-webapp.yaml**. 

    ![](content/mod6image16.png)

1. Go into each of the 3 files individually and replace all instances of the existing ACR name **devopslabacr** with the new ACR name that you just created **(enter your ACR name in all lowercase, otherwise you will get an error later\!)**. 

    >Alert:There should be a total of 4 replacements. **Once again, make sure you write your ACR name in lowercase**, e.g. **devopslabacr.azurecr.io demo-webapp:BuildNumber**. If you don't, you may face authentication issues  when AKS tries pulling your container images during deployment. The Kubernetes task in the Azure Pipeline will create a secret using the lowercase ACR address, therefore the ACR name in the yaml needs to match. 

1. Similarly, navigate to the **frontend.yaml** file located in **Exercise2** directory. Replace the image name prefix with the new ACR that you just created instead of the default value **devopslabacr**.

    ![](content/mod6ex3serviceconsave.png)


 

# Create new build pipeline
>Note:If you want to avoid creating the pipeline step by step, you can skip this task and jump to [Optional: Import a build pipeline](#optional-import-a-build-pipeline).

In this task, you are going to create a build pipeline which will be executed on a Linux agent and will produce two Linux container images for your Web App and Web API applications. These images will be tagged automatically with the appropriate build number and then pushed into your Azure Container Registry (ACR) instance. 

![](content/aka_linux.png)



1.  Navigate to **Pipelines** - **Builds** page and then click **New pipeline**. 
   
    ![](content/mod6image18_2.png)

    ![](content/mod6image22_3.png)

1. Click on **Get sources** task and leave the default options. 
    
    ![](content/mod6image23_2.jpg)

1. Now you will begin adding the necessary tasks to build the web application and web API. You will click the **+** sign to add new tasks: 

    ![](content/mod6image24.png) 

1.  Normally, you might need to add **dotnet build** and **publish** steps, however these are included inside of the Dockerfile and are completed as part of the Docker build process. Just remember when you are creating your own CI/CD pipelines to either include the dotnet build and publish steps in the Dockerfile or the CI build pipeline. For your reference, here is the Dockerfile: 

    ```
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1 AS build-env
    WORKDIR /app
    # Copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
    COPY \*.csproj ./
    RUN dotnet restore
    # Copy everything else and build
    COPY . ./
    RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out
    
    # Build runtime image
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=build-env /app/out .
    ENTRYPOINT \["dotnet", "mywebapp.dll"\]
    ```


1. Add a **Docker** task to build container image for web API application.

    ![](content/mod6image25.png) 

1. Select the newly added **buildAndPush** task and then proceed to the **Container registry** field. In the Dropdown select the previously created service connection **ContainerRegistry**

    ![](content/setconnectionname.png)

1. Enter the name of the specific repository, demo-webapi, within your ACR that can be used to retrieve the Web API image.

    |**Dockerfile**: |**+++mywebapp/Dockerfile**+++|
    |**Build Context**: |**+++mywebapp**+++|
    |**Tags**:| **+++$(Build.BuildId)**+++|

    >Note:In order to retrieve these images from ACR and deploy them to the Kubernetes container orchestrator, you will need to use the same build number in the release pipeline. Therefore, you need to place the build number in the Kubernetes deployment configuration files: **backend-webapi.yaml** and **frontend-webapp.yaml** 

1. Add a **Command Line Script** task after the newly created Docker tasks. 
    
    ![](content/mod6image97.PNG)  

    Configure the first **Command Line Script** task as follows: 

    ![](content/media/image175.png)

    Configure the first **Command Line task** as follows:

    |Property|Value|
    |:--|:--|
    |**Display Name**: |**+++Replace build number in backend-webapi.yaml file**+++|
    |**Script**: |**+++bash -c "sed -i 's/BuildNumber/$(Build.BuildId)/g'  backend-webapi.yaml"**+++|

# Exercise 4: Create Release Pipeline for AKS Cluster

In this exercise, you will create a Release Pipeline which will pull container images from ACR (result of a previous build task), and then deploy these images as containers to a Kubernetes cluster on AKS.  

>Note:If you want to avoid creating the pipeline step by step, you can skip this task and jump to [Optional: import a release pipeline](#optional-import-a-release-pipeline).

The build pipeline is used for compiling the application, building a container image(s), and then pushing the container image(s) to a container registry. The release pipeline, on the other hand, is used to pull the container image(s) from a container registry and then deploy them as containers to the cluster.  


[Return to list of exercises](#module-6-table-of-contents) - [Return to list of modules](#modules)

# Exercise 5: Create Build Pipeline for Windows Containers in AKS

In this task, you are going to create a build pipeline which will be executed on Windows agent and will produce one Windows container image for the Web App front-end. The web front-end is an ASP.NET 4.7.x MVC Application hosted in an IIS Windows container and makes a request to the Quotes Linux API Service deployed in the previous exercise. This image will be tagged automatically with the appropriate build numbers and then pushed to the Azure Container Registry (ACR). Instead of creating the pipeline from scratch, we will import a JSON definition of the pipeline.

# **Lab: GitHub: CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
## **Introduction**
In this lab, you will create a workflow using YAML and GitHub Actions to build your code, and deploy an application to Azure Kubernetes Service.

You'll learn:
- The basic structure of GitHub Action YAML workflows
- How to configure a workflow to build and deploy a containerized application to Azure

## **Prerequisites**
The following items are required for this lab.

- A GitHub account from [https://github.com](https://github.com)
- An Azure DevOps account from [https://dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com)
- **Requirement**: You have to complete both **Module 5** and **Module 6** prior to working on this lab.


## **Exercise 1: Moving code to GitHub**
### **Task 1: Import existing Repo from Azure DevOps**
1. Navigate to your **firstproject** project in Azure DevOps.
1. Navigate to **Repos**, then **Files**.

    ![](content/1reposnav.jpg)

1. Navigate to the root of the **firstproject** repo and choose **Clone**.

    ![](content/2clonebutton.jpg)

1. Open up Notepad and copy the HTTPS url that is shown to a place that will be easily accessible later (ex. a text file).

1. Click **Generate Git Credentials** to prompt a username and password that will be used to authorize importing this repo into GitHub. **Copy the username and password to the same place as the URL in the previous step**.  

    ![](content/3gitcreds.jpg)

1. Now navigate to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.  As a part of the requirement you should have created your own GitHub account.  If you already have one, you can use that as well.

1. Select **New Repository**    

    ![](content/4githubnewrepo.jpg)

1. Choose the option to **Import a repository** and fill in the required fields using the clone URL from Azure DevOps, give your repository a name, and choose a privacy option. Select **Begin Import**.

    ![](content/5aimportrepo.jpg)   

    ![](content/5importrepop1.jpg)

1. GitHub will then prompt you for credentials to complete the import process. Enter the username and password copied from Azure DevOps. Then click **Submit**.

    ![](content/6importrepop2.jpg)
    
1. Once complete, all of the files and history from Azure DevOps should now be present in GitHub. Navigate to your new repo.

    ![](content/7newgithubrepo.jpg)

### Congratulations!

You have successfully completed this exercise. Click **Next** to advance to the next exercise.



## **Exercise 2: Adding Secrets in GitHub**
### **Add Secrets in GitHub for connectivity**
1. Now that we have our repo in GitHub, we can start using GitHub Actions to create workflows.  We are going to need to create the connection to the Azure Container registry and Azure Kubernetes Service just like we did in DevOps lab, so to make it easy we will just store ACR password and service principal for AKS as the GitHub Secret.

2.  Navigate to the Azure Container Registry in portal and copy one of the passwords from **Settings -> Access keys** section 
    ![](content/10secrets2.jpg)

3. Navigate to **Settings -> Secrets** and click on the New repository secret button to create a secret.
    ![](content/10secrets.jpg)

4.  For the name of the secret type **ACR_SECRET** and in the value field paste the ACR password you copied in the step above, then click on **Add secret** button to save.
    ![](content/10secrets3.jpg)

5.  Open the **Poweshell** and run the following command to create a service principal with the contriutor role on the Azure Kubernetes Service.

    ![](content/10secrets4.jpg)

    ```
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "git-hub-secret" --sdk-auth --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/@lab.CloudSubscription.Id/resourcegroups/@lab.CloudResourceGroup(containerswrkshp).Name/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/aks-k8s-cluster

    ```
    - Replace {subscription-id}, {resource-group} with the correct values that correspond with your AKS resource. **This might already been done for you, please check the values if they are correct and the name of the cluster**. They can all be found in the **Properties** section of the AKS Cluster in the Azure Portal, or replace the whole path by copying value under **Resource ID**
  

6. The command should output JSON that has the credentials needed:
    
    ```json
    {
        "clientId": "<GUID>",
        "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
        "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
        "tenantId": "<GUID>",
        ...
    }
    ```
    ![](content/10secrets5.jpg)

7. Copy entire JSON to a place that will be easily accessible later. 

8. Navigate back to your GitHub repo and select your repository **Settings** tab. Choose **Secrets** then **New repository secret**. 

    ![](content/10secrets.jpg)

9. In the **Name** field input `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. Paste the JSON that you copied from the previous steps into the **Value** section of the secret. 
    
    ![](content/10secrets6.jpg)

10. Select **Add secret** to save the secret. This secret will be used in the deploy section of the workflow.  You should now have 2 secrets saved.

    ![](content/10secrets7.jpg)

### Congratulations!

You have successfully completed this exercise. Click **Next** to advance to the next exercise.



## **Exercise 3: Deploying an AKS application to Azure with GitHub Actions**

### **Create basic build and deploy YAML workflow**

1. Select the **Actions** tab.  

    ![](content/8navtoactions.jpg)   

    Note: If the **Actions** menu option is not available you must enable it in **Settings**. Select **Allow all Actions** and then click **Save**.

    ![](content/9enableactionssettings.jpg)

2. Once in the **Actions** section you will see templates that are available to be used as starting points for your workflows. Choose to skip this and create empty workflow by clicking on link **set up a workflow yourself**.

    ![](content/10actionspage.jpg) 

3. You should now have a new basic YAML workflow file. Remove everything from the workflow.  We are going to paste the completed pipeline there.

    ![](content/10emptyworkflow.jpg)   

4.  Navigate to **C:\labs\module6-ext** folder and open github.txt file.  Copy the context of the file and paste in the empty workflow area in GitHub.

    ![](content/deploy1.jpg)

5.  Replace **\<resource-group-name>** and **\<acr-name>** with the name of your resource group and name of your container registry.  It should something like this

    ![](content/deploy2.jpg)

6.  Before we go ahead and run the pipeline, let's review the workflow first.

    ![](content/deploy3.jpg)
    - The `name:` attribute names the workflow

    - The `on:` attribute specifies that when a push or pull request is done to the repo on the `master` branch the workflow should be triggered
    - The `env:` attribute is used to set the environment variables to be used throughout the workflow
  
    - The workflow currently has two jobs called **build** and **deploy**

    ![](content/deploy4.jpg)

    - Build job is named "**Build and push image to container registry**" and that is only thing its doing.

    - The `runs-on:` attribute specifies that the hosted runner the build should use is **ubuntu-latest**

    - There is only 2 `steps` in this job and they are GitHub action and "Build and push image to ACR" task. The first is a GitHub Action [actions/checkout@v2](https://github.com/actions/checkout) that gets the code from your repo to the VM runner.  In the second step we log into the Azure Container registry, we are building the images from Dockerfile, tagging the images with the GitHub run_id and pushing the images to Azure Container Registry.
  
        ![](content/deploy5.jpg)

    - Deploy job has eleven `steps`.  Again, the first is a GitHub Action [actions/checkout@v2](https://github.com/actions/checkout) that gets the code from your repo to the VM runner. Then we are going to log in using the **AZURE_CREDENTIALS** secret we created earlier.

        ![](content/deploy6.jpg)

    - We have a step to autheticate with the cluster using **az aks get-credentials command** so that we can run kubernetes commands.  
        
        ![](content/deploy7.jpg)

    - We create the namespace called **github** in the cluster, then create a secret for AKS to be able to communicate with the Azure Container Registry.  

        ![](content/deploy8.jpg)

    - Next step is to replace the existing YAML files with the updated image tag and publishing them as artifacts.  We have done the similar thing in the DevOps lab. 
        
        ![](content/deploy9.jpg)

    - Lastly, we use k8s-deploy task to deploy the application to Kubernetes cluster, and after its complete we log out.
        
        ![](content/deploy10.jpg)

7.  Commit the file to the *master* branch. Since a `on: [push]` trigger was defined for this branch, the commit should trigger the workflow to run.

    ![](content/11commityaml.jpg)


8.  Navigate to the **Actions** section to see the status of the workflow run. Select the first run which should be named by the commit message given in the previous step.
   
    ![](content/12firstrunofbuild.jpg)

    ![](content/12firstrunofbuildp1.jpg)
    

9.  Click on the **build** job from the Summary page to view the logs. You can see that the build and test steps were successful.

    ![](content/13checkbuildlogs.jpg)

10. Click on the Deploy Job to view the steps have completed successfully.
    
11. If there are no errors we should check for the deployed application in Azure Portal.

12. Navigate to the **Kubernetes Resources** section in the Azure Kubernetes Service and click on **Services and ingresses** section. Click on the External IP link to navigate to the application.

    ![](content/aks.jpg)

13. Following page shouold open if successful.

    ![](content/aks2.jpg)

## Exercise 1: Enable Azure Monitor for Containers in an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster 

Azure Monitor for Containers is a feature designed to monitor the performance of container workloads deployed to either Azure Container Instances or managed Kubernetes clusters hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).  

Azure Monitor for containers gives you performance visibility by collecting memory and processor metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers that are available in Kubernetes through the Metrics API. Container logs are also collected. 

After you enable monitoring from Kubernetes clusters, metrics and logs are automatically collected for you through a containerized version of the Log Analytics agent for Linux. 

Metrics are written to the metrics store and log data is written to the logs store associated with your Log Analytics workspace.
>Note: With the preview release of Windows Server support for AKS, a Linux node automatically deployed in the cluster as part of the standard deployment collects and forwards the data to Azure Monitor on behalf all Windows nodes in the cluster.***
